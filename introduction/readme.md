## Tools and frameworks

* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for its [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) plugin
* [SCSS-Lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) is our preferred linter for `SCSS`. See our custom [linting rules](https://github.com/Shopify/css/blob/master/.scss-lint.yml) and plugins [linting rules](https://github.com/Shopify/css/blob/master/scss-lint-plugins)
* [SassDoc](https://github.com/SassDoc/) is our preferred form of documentation

## Philosophy and structure

We strive to write modular, component driven CSS that is reusable and has a clear separation of concerns. We want an accessible codebase that makes it easy for both newcomers and old-hands to understand, navigate, and change features.

Two of the key things to keep in mind when developing are:

1. Reusable components first
2. Page specific only as a last resort

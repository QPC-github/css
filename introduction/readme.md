# Introduction

This document outlines the concepts required to write Sass in our design system. Following this document ensures that everyone is writing markup and styling that feels familiar and can be maintained by anyone with little overhead.

## Tools and frameworks

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is our preprocessor of choice
* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for its [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) plugin
* [SCSS-Lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) is our preferred linter for `SCSS`. See our custom [linting rules](https://github.com/Shopify/css/blob/master/.scss-lint.yml) and plugins [linting rules](https://github.com/Shopify/css/blob/master/scss-lint-plugins)

## Philosophy and structure

We strive to write modular, component driven CSS that is reusable and has a clear separation of concerns. We want an accessible codebase that makes it easy for both newcomers and old-hands to understand, navigate, and change features.

Two of the key things to keep in mind when developing are:

1. Reusable components first
2. Page specific only as a last resort

For more specific information on our markup and CSS code styles see our [Markup and Styling Style Guide](https://github.com/Shopify/markup-and-styling-style-guide).
